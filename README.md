## Who I Am

Hello, I'm *Noah*. Below is a bit of a self-introduction.

### **Professional Edition** of Who I Am

I'm a third year Computer Engineering major with a minor in Chinese Studies.

> I would say I lucked out picking the major I have. I took an introductory programming course in high school and really enjoyed that, but also really enjoyed the various physics courses I took as well. I took a bit of a gander on the major I chose and I couldn't be happier. It has allowed me to diversify my knowledge toolkit and let me explore different career paths.

On campus I am involved as a tutor for the Electrical Engineering Department, and as a Campus Ambassador (campus tour guide). I am currently looking to get involved in research to explore academia as a potential career path.

I know I have a lot to learn, but as of now, my favorite programming languages are:

- C#
- C++
- [SQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

> Honestly, I am not too sure which niche of Computer Science I want to go into, but hey, I guess that's the point of college.

This is my to-do list as it stands now:

- [X] Attend high school
- [X] Go to college
- [ ] Pursue graduate school?

To wrap the *professional* section up, I will leave you with my favorite block of code.

```

if (!work)
{
    work = true;
}
```

### Free time me

I enjoy spending time with friends (virtually, for the time being) and my two dogs (pictures below).

I have been studying Mandarin for the past 5 years, with the eventual goal of studying abroad in China. I had a trip planned for Summer of 2020, but unfortunately it was postponed due to COVID-19. I am certainly hoping that I will get to study abroad at some point in my college career, and I've continued to study Mandarin in my free time (mostly by watching Chinese tv shows).
